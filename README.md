# This KAIM - week o challenge
# Solar Radiation Measurement Data Analysis
# Project Overview

Welcome to my project on solar radiation measurement data analysis! In this project, I aimed to explore and analyze solar radiation data from various regions, specifically focusing on enhancing operational efficiency and sustainability for MoonLight Energy Solutions. My goal was to identify high-potential areas for solar installation, aligning with the company's long-term sustainability objectives.

# Data Description

The dataset consists of environmental measurements that include the following parameters:

Timestamp (yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm): The date and time of each observation.
GHI (W/m²): Global Horizontal Irradiance, representing total solar radiation on a horizontal surface.
DNI (W/m²): Direct Normal Irradiance, the solar radiation received perpendicular to the sun's rays.
DHI (W/m²): Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance, indicating solar radiation received indirectly.
ModA (W/m²) & ModB (W/m²): Measurements from two different modules or sensors similar to irradiance.
Tamb (°C): Ambient temperature in degrees Celsius.
RH (%): Relative humidity as a percentage.
WS (m/s): Wind speed in meters per second.
WSgust (m/s): Maximum wind gust speed.
WSstdev (m/s): Standard deviation of wind speed.
WD (°N): Wind direction measured in degrees from north.
WDstdev: Standard deviation of wind direction.
BP (hPa): Barometric pressure in hectopascals.
Cleaning (1 or 0): Indicates if cleaning occurred for the sensors.
Precipitation (mm/min): Rate of precipitation measured in millimeters per minute.
TModA (°C) & TModB (°C): Temperatures of Modules A and B.

# Analysis Approach

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): I performed a detailed EDA to identify key trends and insights from the solar radiation metrics.
2. Statistical Analysis: I used statistical methods to evaluate the performance of different regions based on their solar radiation data.
3. Visualization: I created visual representations of the data to highlight significant findings, such as seasonal variations and regional comparisons.

# Key Findings

I. Identification of regions with the highest average GHI and DNI values, indicating optimal conditions for solar energy production.
II. Analysis of environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and precipitation that influence solar panel efficiency.
III. Recommendations for targeted solar investments based on the insights gained from the data.

# Conclusion

This project serves as a strategic analysis for MoonLight Energy Solutions, providing data-driven recommendations for solar investments. By identifying high-potential regions for solar installation, I aim to support the company’s sustainability goals and enhance operational efficiency.
